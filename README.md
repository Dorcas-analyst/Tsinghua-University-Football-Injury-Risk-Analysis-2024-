## Overview
This project analyzes injury risks among 800 Tsinghua University football players using a fully Excel-driven workflow. Through data cleaning, segmentation, and pivot-table analysis, we identify patterns and predictors influencing next-season injuries and provide actionable recommendations for coaches and athletic departments.
----
## Objectives
- Identify lifestyle, training, and physical factors that affect injury likelihood.
- Build a structured Excel analytics workflow for sports-science insights.
- Recommend strategies to reduce injury risk and improve player performance.
---
## Dataset Summary
- Source: Kaggle
- Rows: 800 players
- Data Type: Structured tabular data
---
## Data Preparation
- No missing or duplicate values
- Standardized numeric fields
- Applied Excel formulas for:
- Nutrition classification
- Injury labeling
- Warm-up adherence
- Age formatting
- Pivot tables, slicers, and conditional formatting used for segmentation
---
## Key Findings
- Nutrition is the strongest injury predictor
- Poor nutrition → 0.74 injury probability
- Good nutrition → 0.21 probability
- Warm-up non-adherence increases injuries
- 40% of players inconsistently warm up
- Sleep directly affects stress
- Peak match involvement at 10–11 training hours/week
---
## Recommendations
- Optimize training load (9–10 hours/week)
- Weekly structured recovery sessions
- Age-targeted reaction training
- Improve warm-up compliance
- Hire/assign nutritionists
---
## Conclusion: This project shows that injury prediction is multidimensional, shaped not only by physical capability but also by nutrition, discipline, warm-up habits, and psychological factors. Excel proved to be an effective platform for uncovering these insights and delivering actionable strategies to reduce preventable injuries and enhance player performance.
